Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers of the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, fare, etc.

Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle's Titanic page. It contains the following files:

train.csv: Training set
test.csv: Test set
gender_submission.csv: Sample submission file
Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with several Python libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps are crucial for cleaning and preparing the data for model training. The preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature engineering
Normalization/Standardization
The preprocessing code is located in the preprocess.py file.

Model Training
The model training involves using machine learning algorithms to learn from the preprocessed data and make predictions on the test set. The training code is located in the train_model.py file.

Evaluation
After training the model, it's important to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. The evaluation code is located in the evaluate_model.py file.
